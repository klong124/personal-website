            A serpent lights the ancient sky<br/>A threat of tainted stars<br/>Evil stirs and in its wake<br/>The
            souls of mortals sway<br/><br/>Sorrow reigns<br/>Over fields of red<br/>Spirits pace<br/>Through the
            shadows cast by their graves<br/><br/>These are days and nights of venom and blood<br/>Heroes will rise as
            the anchors fall<br/>Brave the strife, reclaim every soul<br/>That belongs to the Beauty of Dawn<br/><br/>Darkness
            strives to blind the strong<br/>But Faith will guide our swords<br/>Loyal hearts we'll stand as one<br/>And
            fight with shields of Hope<br/><br/>Pride fuels the deadly fire<br/>That devours our tower of gold<br/>The
            drums of war will rage and roar<br/>&lsquo;Til the sun burns bright once more<br/><br/>These are days and
            nights of venom and blood<br/>Heroes will rise as the anchors fall<br/>Brave the strife, reclaim every
            soul<br/>That belongs to the Beauty of Dawn
